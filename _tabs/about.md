- As a Software Data Engineer, I design and build scalable data pipelines (currently working with Spark/Databricks) and develop microservices with FastAPI (my expertise lies in automation, software engineering, and data processing to drive business solutions).
- As an Aspiring Security Engineer I'm actively expanding my expertise in cybersecurity, particularly in offensive/red team activities and security engineering. Using Medium, X, YouTube and TryHackMe platform, I'm honing practical skills in penetration testing and security analysis as I work towards transitioning into a Offensive Security Engineer role.
